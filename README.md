# üöó Car Information Program 
### This is a simple Java OOP program that allows the user to display car information.

#### This projcet demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
- Encapsulation (private fields with getters/setters)
- Constructor & Method Overloading(same name, different parameters)
- Method Overriding(Subclasses redefine parent methods)
- Polymorphism (parent refrence pointing to child objects)

The program simulates different types of cars (Car, ElectricCar, SportCar) and prints information about them.

üìÇ Project Strcture 
```bash
ObjectOriented
|___ Car.java          # Base class (Encapsulation + Overloading)
|___ ElectricCar.java  # Subclass (Overrides methods, adds battery capacity)
|___ SportsCar.java    # Subclass (Overrides methods, adds top speed)
|___  Main.java         # Entry point with main() method
```

‚öôÔ∏è How to compile and run the program 
```bash
Clone the respo: git clone https://github.com/Eelaf-Adam/-Object-Oriented-Analysis-and-Design.git
Change directory: cd ObjectOriented
```

1. Make sure you have Java installed
2. Save all files in the same folder
3. Open terminal
4. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac *.Java
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
